# DadiBot
The DadiBot is a Discord Bot with a lot of Features like Fortnite Stats or a Meme Generator.

## Getting Started
These Instructions will show you how you can add the Bot to your Discord and how you can configure it.

### Add the Bot to your Discord
Please notice that you that you need to be the Owner of your Discord Server to invite the Bot!

[invite]: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=396990218751967254&permissions=8&scope=bot
[ ![Invite](/img/logo1_widget_invite.png) ][invite]

### Permissions
The easiest way for setting up the Permissions is to give him the `Administrator` Permission, because then, the Bot works everywhere fine without problems. When you don't trust the Bot you can give him the Permissions separately, but the Bot needs definitely the Permissions to `read the message history`, `read messages`, `write messages`, `delete (manage) messages` and especially `use embed links`.

### Prefix
The default Prefix for the Bot is `-`. At the moment you can't edit it, but this Feature will come soon!
